I took the code from Adam Khoury found online here[http://www.developphp.com/view.php?tid=1393]

I annotated the code, added some new funtionality as required by the assignemnt. 

Spent a considerable amount of time analyzing the particular approach that was taken, and  will work to refactor the code with skills I've learned over the course of the program. Especially, to avoid adding a method to a built-in object (array) which is what the original author did to overcome the "shuffling" and randomizing tile placement. I feel that there is a better way, likely to create a custom object that inherits from the array prototype and adding the additional method there.
